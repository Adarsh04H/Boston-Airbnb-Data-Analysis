# Boston-Airbnb-Data-Analysis

**Project Plan**
Analyzing Airbnb’s publicly accessible data about a city's Airbnb listings and analyze metrics such as 
number of listings, the number of reviews for the listings, home types, availability, average occupancy, and more. We are also integrating a second datsets containing statistics on the population and median income based on zip codes. Combining the two datasets we will try to draw insights into how Airbnb’s business varies by location as well as understand the effect of neighborhood on Airbnb prices.
 
Data Source: 
The data is collected from the insideairbnb.com website(http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). 
The data is in the form of csv file and has 3 different files. The data is divided into 3 factors –

2)	Listings – This contains the listings, location, host info, prices, occupancy and many more. 
3)	Reviews – This dataset contains reviews of the host and Airbnb, reviewer info and dates.
